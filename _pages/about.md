bio: <p> I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href='https://bair.berkeley.edu'>UC Berkeley</a>, CA, USA, under the mentorship of <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa'>Angjoo Kanazawa</a> and  <a href='http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik'>Jitendra Malik</a>. Before that, I was a PhD student at the <a href='https://is.mpg.de'>Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, in the Perceiving Systems Department lead by <a href='https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black'>Michael Black</a>. During the third year of my PhD, I got to visit UC Berkeley for six months to work with Angjoo Kanazawa. Before my PhD, I received my M.Sc. in Computational and Data Science from the <a href='https://www.uni-jena.de'>University of Jena</a>, where we analysed how humans influence each other's facial expressions in conversations. In my Bachelor's, I studied Mathematics with Psychology as an application subject at the <a href='https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/de'>University of Heidelberg</a>.</p>

research: <p> My research area is computer vision, in particular <b>3D virtual humans</b>, their <b>physical appearance</b> and <b>social interactions</b> involving <b>touch</b>. This involves estimating 3D human pose and shape from an image for a single person, but also for multiple people who interact, for example, while shaking hands or hugging. My goal is to understand how humans interact, communicate, and behave towards each other at scale.</p> <p><a href='https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/post/could-body-shape-determine-the-german-election'>Here</a> is a short blog post that uses some of our research on body shape estimation during the German Election (Bundestagswahl) 2021. It is written for everyone, also for those not working in computer vision. </p>
