bio:
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [UC Berkeley](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), CA, USA, under the mentorship of [Angjoo Kanazawa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/) and [Jitendra Malik](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/). Before that, I was a PhD student at the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, in the Perceiving Systems Department lead by [Michael Black](https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black). During the third year of my PhD, I got to visit UC Berkeley for six months to work with Angjoo Kanazawa. Before my PhD, I received my M.Sc. in Computational and Data Science from the [University of Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/), where we analysed how humans influence each other's facial expressions in conversations. In my Bachelor's, I studied Mathematics with Psychology as an application subject at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/de).
