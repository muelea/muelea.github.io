bio: <p> I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href='https://bair.berkeley.edu'>UC Berkeley</a>, CA, USA, working on human body pose and shape reconstruction and human behavior understanding under the mentorship of <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa'>Angjoo Kanazawa</a> and  <a href='http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik'>Jitendra Malik</a>. During my PhD at the <a href='https://is.mpg.de'>Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, in the Perceiving Systems Department lead by <a href='https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black'>Michael Black</a>, my research focused on 3D human pose and body shape estimation from images. I specialized in understanding and reconstructing physical contact humans make with themselves and with other people during interaction.</p> <details><summary>Show more bio ...</summary><p>During the third year of my PhD, I got to visit UC Berkeley for six months to work with <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa'>Angjoo Kanazawa</a>. This collaboration was a great experience that allowed me to learn broader concepts in computer vision and apply them to the field of social interaction. I was further lucky to learn from and collaborate with postdoctoral researchers, in particular <a href='https://research.adobe.com/person/paulchhuang'>Chun-Hao Paul Huang</a>, <a href='http://www.dtzionas.com'>Dimitris Tzionas</a>, and <a href='https://geopavlakos.github.io'>Georgios Pavlakos</a>, and to receive support and guidance from <a href='https://is.mpg.de/person/kjk'>Katherine Kuchenbecker</a> and <a href='https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/people/pons-moll.html'>Gerard Pons-Moll</a> as part of my thesis advisory committee. <br><br> Prior to my PhD, I graduated from the <a href='https://www.uni-jena.de'>University of Jena</a> in Computational and Data Science. Advised by <a href='https://inf-cv.uni-jena.de/home/group/denzler/'>Joachim Denzler</a>, we collaborated with the department of general psychology and cognitive neuroscience to investigate how humans influence each other's facial expressions in conversations from video data. In my Bachelor's, I studied Mathematics with Psychology as an application subject at the <a href='https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/de'>University of Heidelberg</a>.</p></details>

research: <p> My research area is computer vision, in particular <b>3D virtual humans</b>, their <b>physical appearance</b> and <b>social interactions</b> involving <b>touch</b>. This involves estimating 3D human pose and shape from an image for a single person, but also for multiple people during interaction. My goal is to understand how humans communicate and behave towards each other at scale.</p> <p>Why touch? Because it lets us navigate the world and directly effects human behavior. For example, did you know that touch increases generosity towards the touch-giver? <a href='https://muelea.github.io/blog/2021/touch'>Here</a> is a blog post explaining why touch is important and how it effects our life. I am truely excited about this line of research!</p> <p>One aspect of human touch is a person's body shape. In <a href='https://ps.is.mpg.de/uploads_file/attachment/attachment/691/00928.pdf'>SHAPY</a>, we reconstruct human body shape from a single image using linguistic body shape attributes. We can further leverage our methods together with human annotations to investiagte body shape bias. In <a href='https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/post/could-body-shape-determine-the-german-election'>this</a> blog post we use our research to uncover potential body shape biases based on the 2021 German Election (Bundestagswahl) Candidates. </p>
